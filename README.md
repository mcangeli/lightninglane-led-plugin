# LightningLane LED Plugin

A [bullpen](https://github.com/MLB-LED-Scoreboard/mlb-led-scoreboard) plugin for the MLB LED Scoreboard that displays live Walt Disney World attraction wait times on an RGB LED matrix.

Powered by [LightningLane-Live-LED](https://github.com/jc214809/LightningLane-Live-LED) and the [ThemeParks Wiki API](https://api.themeparks.wiki) (no API key required).

## What it displays

Each cycle through the plugin shows (8 seconds per frame):

1. **Mickey Mouse silhouette** — intro screen
2. **Trip countdown** *(if `trip_dates` is configured)* — "COUNTDOWN TO DISNEY X Days", or "Have a Magical Trip!" within 7 days after the trip
3. **For each operating WDW park:**
   - Park info screen — park name, hours, Lightning Lane Multi Pass price, and current weather
   - Each displayable attraction — ride name and standby wait time

Attractions that are CLOSED or under REFURBISHMENT are skipped. DOWN rides are shown with their downtime in red. The display updates in the background every `refresh_seconds` (default 5 minutes). When no configured parks are operating (e.g. overnight), `is_active` is set to `False` and the scoreboard drops back to its normal game rotation automatically.

**Supported board sizes:** 64×32 and 64×64

## Installation

**Raspberry Pi** (from your mlb-led-scoreboard directory):

```bash
sudo venv/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/mcangeli/lightninglane-led-plugin.git
```

**Mac / local development** (editable install):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcangeli/lightninglane-led-plugin.git
cd /path/to/mlb-led-scoreboard
venv/bin/pip install -e /path/to/lightninglane-led-plugin
```

## Updating

To update to the latest version, re-run the install command with `--force-reinstall` (from your mlb-led-scoreboard directory):

```bash
sudo venv/bin/pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/mcangeli/lightninglane-led-plugin.git
```

> **Note:** PyPI publishing is planned for a future release. Once available, updating will simply be `sudo venv/bin/pip install --upgrade lightninglane-led-plugin`.

## Configuration

Add a screen entry to `rotation.screens` and a `"plugins"` section to your MLB LED Scoreboard `config.json`:

```json
{
  "rotation": {
    "screens": [
      {
        "kind": "lightninglane",
        "priority": 1
      }
    ]
  },
  "plugins": {
    "lightninglane": {
      "parks": ["Magic Kingdom", "EPCOT", "Hollywood Studios", "Animal Kingdom"],
      "refresh_seconds": 300,
      "trip_dates": [
        "2026-06-17"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The `priority` field tells the scoreboard to raise its priority level to `1` whenever any configured park is open (`is_active = True`). When all parks close, `is_active` goes `False` and the scoreboard drops back to its normal game rotation.

`parks` accepts any park name supported by the [ThemeParks Wiki API](https://api.themeparks.wiki) — Walt Disney World, Disneyland, Universal, Cedar Point, and more. Omit the key entirely to default to all four WDW theme parks.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `parks` | list of strings | all WDW parks | Parks to display. Accepts any destination supported by ThemeParks Wiki (e.g. `"Magic Kingdom"`, `"Cedar Point"`, `"Universal Studios Florida"`). |
| `refresh_seconds` | int | `300` | How often (in seconds) the background thread re-fetches live wait times. |
| `trip_dates` | list | `[]` | List of upcoming trip dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Drives the countdown screen. Multiple dates are supported; the nearest upcoming date is shown. |

## How it works

The plugin registers itself via the `bullpen.mlbled.plugin` entry point. When bullpen loads it, three objects are created:

- **`Config`** — reads `parks`, `refresh_seconds`, and `trip_dates` from `config.json`
- **`Data`** — on first update, fetches the WDW park list then starts a daemon background thread that polls live attraction wait times on the configured interval
- **`Renderer`** — runs a phase-based cycle: Mickey intro → trip countdown (if active) → parks; resumes where it left off if the scoreboard rotates away mid-cycle

** Thank you to @JC214809 for the ground work, I updated his code to limit pillow to match mlb-led-scoreboard in an attempt to get this to work...
